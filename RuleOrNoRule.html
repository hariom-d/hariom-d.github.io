    Here we will keep small-small nuggets of information that will act as takeaways. This is not a blog space. We expect the
    users to spend under 5 minutes on a nugget and walk out happily with a solid understanding on something useful.
    <br> The text below is taken from an email we received for the post of a scriptwriter with us. This explains what kind of nuggets we should keep here.
    <br><br>
    The dichotomy between formal and informal speech when it comes to grammar. In my experience, most native English speakers
    make grammatical errors regularly in their day-to-day conversations (I have a number of â€˜pet hatesâ€™ that I wonâ€™t get
    into now). Because of this (and note that I should never start a sentence with â€˜becauseâ€™!), written dialogue that adheres
    strictly to grammatical correctness can often come across as quite jarring in relation to everyday speech. Iâ€™m sure this
    occurs in every language, but itâ€™s something that might require some negotiation/accommodation as you progress. As an
    example, Iâ€™ll refer you to the writing of Science Fiction or Fantasy, more so the latter. A lot of authors try to â€˜archaizeâ€™
    a language in order to give it an exotic or â€˜alienâ€™ sense of delivery for the context. What I mean is that these writers
    forego such things as verbal contractions (didnâ€™t, doesnâ€™t, wasnâ€™t, wonâ€™t, etc.) in favour of what they feel would be
    an older or more â€˜authenticâ€™ way of speaking. Iâ€™ve always found this uncomfortable to read, because it alienates the
    reader from a context in which the author should be trying to immerse them. It also gives no consideration to the imagined
    context of a world in which language has either evolved or is completely disconnected from the reality of our world!
    In the context of what you guys are trying to do, consider aliens in Science Fiction stories or movies who are speaking
    English. If, hypothetically, they had learned English in the manner in which I think you guys are aiming to deliver it,
    they wouldnâ€™t be saying â€˜I shall, I will, I did notâ€™ and so on. They should be taught verbal contractions because thatâ€™s
    how people speak. In short, if youâ€™re not learning how people actually speak, you will always sound â€˜alienâ€™. ðŸ˜Š Iâ€™m not
    saying we should teach bad grammar â€“ I generally deplore it and it certainly wonâ€™t fly in academia or a professional
    environment â€“ but it might be something that will come up along the way.
