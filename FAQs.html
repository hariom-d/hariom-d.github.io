        <b>Q.</b> Why learn to speak from Nalanda?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> Our focus is mainly on spoken English and use unique techniques that will save massive time and effort
        of the learners.

        <b>Q.</b> What is an "expression"?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> We define "expression" as a reusable pattern in a communication. Speakers make a sentence NOT by a sequence
        of individual words. Instead, a sentence is made by a sequence of expressions(reusable patterns) and words.
        <br> Human brain tries to remember/use these reusable patterns as one single unit. This way the brain does not have to
        think/process hard to make a sentence quickly. Even the quality of the communication can be significantly improved
        by using the frequently used
        <i>elegant expressions</i>.

        <b>Q.</b> Are Idioms/phrasal verbs same as expressions?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> No. Idioms/Phrasal verbs are only a small subset of the expressions. Only popular expressions will be
        our focus to give the best value out of the time and effort of learners.

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col">
        <b>Q.</b> How do you asses the popularity rating of the expressions?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> We have placed trust in the native speakers and do not claim that the popularity rating is precise.
        There is no need to be very picky about popularity rating of some expressions.
        <br> We allow users to provide the comments on expressions and videos and would be happy to update the content based
        on the feedback.

        <b>Q.</b> How many expressions do you have in your database and how can I learn so many expressions?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> The total number of expressions will be in thousands. But we have divided the content based on user
        types(Student/Professional), their desired level(Basic/Advanced) and the popularity(High/Medium). We will NOT keep
        low popularity expressions as we believe that users should focus more on immidiately useful content to get better
        value out of their time and effort.

        <b>Q.</b> Why do you recommend using expressions as prime technique to SPEAK a language?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> Some learners make a mistake of spending a lot of time in learning difficult or not so commonly used
        words and focus less on simple yet powerful expressions. In conversation English, simplicity is the key and gives
        tremendous confidence to the learner.

        <b>Q.</b> I can understand most of what native speakers speak in daily life/movies/soaps. Still I find it difficult
        to speak comfortably. Why?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> Based on our understanding and the research done on internet, people tend to use words/expressions that
        they have used before and are comfortable about. The words they have never spoken before may cause confusion in the
        mind and the person starts stuttering and may become demotivated.
        <br> We advise learners to speak using simple words/expressions and avoid difficult and less popular words. Focus on
        a few commonly used contexts rather than trying to learn every context of the expression. Be selective and prudent
        in what you learn.
        <br> Keeping this in mind we have included commonly used contexts with the expressions.

        <b>Q.</b> How did you prepare your database of expressions?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> The expressions in our database are prepared by native English speakers. They provided common use cases
        of expressions and their popularity in spoken English. This will directly help learners in staying focussed and not
        wasting any time on stuff that is not so useful for their current needs.

        <b>Q.</b> Why did you prepare videos when expressions provided good examples with context?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> We understand that reading content from web pages can be boring at times and the content also may be
        open to misinterpretation. In order to provide a unique experience to our learners we have prepared highly engaging
        videos that will use some real-life themes to explain a number of expressions from our database.

        <b>Q.</b> I have been advised by my teachers and friends that I should read newspapers/magazine/novels and watch English
        movies/soaps. Are they not effective?
        <br>
        <b>Nalanda:</b> All these resources are a great way to learn English. You need to decide your objective first and the
        amount of time you are willing to devote. If your aim is to speak English then how would you easily know whether
        a particular word/expression is more suitable for writing or used in very formal speeches? Some expressions in movies
        and soaps are slangs and using them without proper care can be a bit off-putting to your listeners.
        <br> In addition to movies/soaps, we recommend learning with Nalanda. Our content is developed within the boundaries
        of decency to avoid any embarrasement for you. Our popularity rating will further help you to choose the right content and
        be more productive in your learning journey.
