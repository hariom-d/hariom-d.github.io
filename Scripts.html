    <h4 style="color:red;">Scripts page</h4>
    Here we will keep all the conversational style scripts that are similar to the dialogues spoken in a theatre play. The purpose
    of such scripts is to show how native speakers do conversations. The users can learn how the expressions are used in
    real life style conversation contexts.
    <br>
    <br> The sample script below shows how a script will look like.
    <br>
    <br>
    <strong> Topic:</strong> A general discussion in a company on an employee leaving the company.
    <br> Roger and Wendy sit at a table. Roger is eating a sandwich while Wendy is
    <span style="color:green">
      <strong>flipping through</strong>
    </span>
    <span style="color:red">a magazine</span> .
    <br>
    <br> Roger: So, did you hear about Tim?
    <br> Wendy: Yeah, I had no idea he was leaving!
    <br> Roger: Neither did he.
    <br> Wendy: What? No way. He was fired?
    <br> Fred walks in.
    <br> Roger: Oh, hey Fred! How’s it goin’?
    <br> Fred: It’s going. Just the usual paperwork to finish up, but
    <span style="color:green">
      <strong> I’m almost caught up</strong>
    </span>.
    <br> Wendy: How was your vacation?
    <br> Fred: It was pretty good. I took the kids to Disneyland and they
    <span style="color:green">
      <strong>absolutely loved it</strong>
    </span>. The little one met all her favourite princesses and my older boy
    <span style="color:green">
      <strong>threw up</strong>
    </span> after Space Mountain. But I’m back to the grind now. So, did you guys hear about Tim?
    <br> Roger and Wendy look at each other.
    <br> Wendy: We were just talking about it. Do you guys know what happened?
    <br> Fred: No. But it was the first thing I heard about since I got back.
    <span style="color:green">
      <strong>It’s such a shame</strong>
    </span>. Tim was a great guy! He was
    <span style="color: green">
      <strong>a bit weird</strong>
    </span>, but he was always really nice to me.
    <br> Roger: Well, I heard he was caught stealing.
    <br> Wendy: What was he caught stealing?
    <br> Roger: Pens.
    <br> Wendy: Pens!
    <br> Roger: Yes, I heard the manager saw him taking pens from the office supply room and hoarding them in his desk. Then
    when he checked the cameras, he saw Tim putting close to twenty pens in his bag.
    <br> Wendy: I don’t understand. Why on earth would he need so many pens? As well, why wouldn’t he just buy them? He makes
    more than we do!
    <br> Fred: Who told you this?
    <br> Roger: Patricia.
    <br> Wendy: How does Patricia know all of this?
    <br> Roger: She was the one who tipped off the manager.
    <br> Fred: What!
    <br> Roger: I’m just joking! You both are so gullible. He left for a better job.
    <br> Wendy: I can’t believe you tricked us! You really had us going.
    <br> Roger: You know, you really shouldn’t gossip so much.
    <br> Wendy: Actually, you were the one doing all the gossiping. I was only listening. I just happen to really care about
    everyone who works here and it’s important for me to know that my colleagues are doing all right.
    <br> Roger and Fred: Sure.
    <br> Wendy: Whatever. Regardless, that’s great to hear! I’m so glad Tim is moving on to better things. He really deserves
    it. I’ve never seen anyone work harder than he did.
    <br> Roger: Yeah, it’s true. I bet he would have slept here if he could have.
    <br> Fred: I wonder, who will take his position?
    <br> Roger: I don’t know but Patricia said management is looking to hire internally for the position.
    <br> Wendy: That’s awesome. So I guess it could be any one of us?
    <br> Fred: Yeah, I guess so.
    <br> Roger: Probably.
    <br> Wendy: I should probably be getting back to work now.
    <br> Fred: Yeah, me too. Catch you later.
    <br> Roger: Yeah, stop slacking off, you two. See you guys later!
    <br> Wendy: Bye! Have a good lunch.
    <br> Roger: Thanks.
